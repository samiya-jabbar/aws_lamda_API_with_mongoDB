**link: https://vr629hy912.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev**

### Guide :
It works on following endpoints:

1) /getitems

This will give you all available items in a shop along with their price.

2) / e.g: /bag , /cap, /mobile

This will give you price of that specific item, if item is not available then it will return "item is not available".

3) /additem

This will add any new item along with its price in mongoDB.

This is how it will give you results.
